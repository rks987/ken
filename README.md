the Ken programming language

ken: "range of knowledge or understanding". The BBC radio show "Beyond Our Ken"
included Kenneth Williams, from whom we get the language's mottos "Stop messing
about" and "No, don't be like that".

Ken was also my grandfather's name, and a recurring name in our family.

This is the latest name for my programming language which has had a lot of
names. People didn't seem to like "wombat".

The plan is to use python with typing, and as functional as I can manage.

I'll start by adding typing to wombat code for lex and compiler.
